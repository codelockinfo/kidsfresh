            "faq_answer": "<p>We believe that what we put into our foods matters just as much as what we choose to leave out. We do not allow the use of BPA in any of our packaging, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.1<br/><br/>BPA stands for Bisphenol A, a chemical that has been used to make plastics and resins since the 1950s. It is found in some food and beverage packaging, and studies have shown that it leaches into the environment, including the foods and beverages we consume. While the Food and Drug Administration has not found any conclusive evidence to link low levels in what we consume to specific health concerns, they continue to monitor the research.2<br/><br/>Other organizations, like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the European Environment Agency, believe that exposure to BPA could have potential health risks at certain levels. And to us, that sounds like more than enough reason to leave it out of our packaging—and out of our kids’ lives.<br/><br/>1. American Academy of Pediatrics. Food Additives: What Parents Should Know.

We are one tool in the toolkit to help with your journey to get kids to eat the foods you want. We are by no means perfect, because who is? But that is what is great about health. It is dependent on the overall day and not any one food. We have a few foods that are considered “high” in sodium and saturated fat, (but not added sugar). So we would call to your attention these foods, because while they have veggies, they also have ingredients contributing to nutrition levels that you need to balance in with other meals throughout the day.</p>"
