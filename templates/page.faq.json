            "faq_answer": "We believe that what we put into our foods matters just as much as what we choose to\nleave out. We do not allow the use of BPA in any of our packaging, as recommended by\nthe American Academy of Pediatrics.1\nBPA stands for Bisphenol A, a chemical that has been used to make plastics and resins\nsince the 1950s. It is found in some food and beverage packaging, and studies have\nshown that it leaches into the environment, including the foods and beverages we\nconsume. While the Food and Drug Administration has not found any conclusive\nevidence to link low levels in what we consume to specific health concerns, they\ncontinue to monitor the research.2\nOther organizations, like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the European\nEnvironment Agency, believe that exposure to BPA could have potential health risks at\ncertain levels. And to us, that sounds like more than enough reason to leave it out of our\npackaging—and out of our kids’ lives.\n1. American Academy of Pediatrics.
